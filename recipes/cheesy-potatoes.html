        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This potato dish is very creamy and has a nice crunch to it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds frozen diced potatoes</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons slated butter</li>
            <li>16 ounces sour cream</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 oz.) can cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 cups crushed potato chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick spray.
                To thaw the potatoes, stick the bags in the fridge overnight. Be sure to drain
                any liquid from thawing.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large bowl - you can do this in the microwave or on the stovetop.
                Let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk the sour cream and the soup into the melted butter until combined. Add a big pinch
                of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Fold in the thawed potatoes. Fold and stir until the potatoes are completely incorporated
                and evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Spread the mixture in the baking dish. Top with the grated cheddar. At this point, you can 
                stick the dish (covered) in the fridge until you're ready to bake, or you can bake right away.</li>
            <li>If baking right away, sprinkle the top with the crushed potato chips.</li>
            <li>Bake for 60 minutes. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Scoop to serve.</li>
        </ol>
